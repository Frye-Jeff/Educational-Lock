# V1 Educational Lock Notes

To assemble this model, you will need to print six parts. You will also need a spring. I used a 3/8 inch by 1 1/4 inch spring from my local hardware store.

I recommend using four colors of filament.

Color 1: 

	Lock Body
	Lock Ring

Color 2:

	Lock Core
	Lock Clip

Color 3:

	Top Pin

Color 4:

	Bottom Pin


Construction:
Press the Lock Ring into the Lock body with the slopped edge to the back of the lock and the notch at the 12 o'clock position. Use a small amount of super glue on the inside of the lock to affix the ring to the body. 
See Figure 1.

Use the lock body to center the lock clip to the lock core and glue the clip to the core. With the core in what would be the locked position, I recommend the tab of the clip be in the 5 o'clock position. The clip/ring prevents the lock from accidentally coming apart during use.
See Figure 2.
