# Educational Lock

I designed a 3D printable demonstration lock for Philly TOOOL or anyone who wants one. 

v1: Contains the STL files I used to print my initial proof of concept. 

v2: Work in progress to redesign from scratch. The goal is to make a functionally identical design  with design files clean enough to share.
