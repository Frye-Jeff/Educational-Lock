# Educational Lock

I designed a 3D printable demonstration lock for Philly TOOOL or anyone who wants one. 

v1: Contains the STL files I used to print my initial proof of concept. 

v2: Is a slightly improved version. Part count is reduced for easier assembly. An attempt was made to make the design parametric. I have included the Fusion files along with STLs.
